In order to create enemies, I had to add their definitions in an array in defineObjectInputs function.
This array is iterated in a loop that is responsible to create the enemy objects, from a constructor function, and place them in an array containing all the enemy objects.
I used the constructor design pattern since it is a good candidate object for later expansion (for example add the ability to kill enemies, having health, providing points to the score, etc).
The enemies are ghost-like and they are able to hover over the ground and over the canyons.
Added ability to patrol in specific ranges that can be defined per enemy
Added ability to adjust their speeds, an option that can be defined per enemy, and create more varied results.
